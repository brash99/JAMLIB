## About
 
The repository contains interpolation tables for the collinear parton
distributions in the nucleon, as well as the collinear parton to hadron
fragmentation functions. The interpolation codes are available in:

* [python](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/JAMLIB/tree/master/python)

* [LHAPDF](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/JAMLIB/tree/master/LHAPDF)

* [fortran](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/JAMLIB/tree/master/fortran)

The usage is described in the README files within each subfolder.
